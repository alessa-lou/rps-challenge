# RPS Challenge

Introduction
============

The intention for this project was to build an implementation of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors where the user plays against an automated response from the computer.

This was a solo project for the Makers Academy week three weekend challenge.

The learning intentions for this project were to test drive the building of a simple web app using Sinatra, with Rspec and Capybara.
